A Minecraft server control panel

  *Server and client  : frash23*  
  *WHMCS Intergration : maxboone*



###A control panel made to satisfy the needs
---
  SAD Panel was made to be more functional, stable and featureful than others available, while being cheaper at the same time.
  SAD-Panel can currently run **Spigot**, **BungeeCord**, **CraftBukkit** and most available Java-based minecraft servers.
  The software is available for licensed purchase at [our main website][main_page].
  
  Current features include:
  
  * Home page with monitoring of online players, CPU usage (that makes sense!) and RAM usage.
  * Intelliget cluster system, creates new serverse on the machine with least load.
  * Lots of features, will write them down another time.
